# O'Reilly Software Architecture Conference - London 2018

Software architecture is an interesting and broad subject. It is a backbone of the (succesful) software delivery and not only the Architects thing. On the talks I had the pleasure to attend few common themes surfaced

- Technology wise: Containers (k8s) and Serverless (FaaS and BaaS) are the main focus in the industry
- We all make mistakes - key thing is recovery (change approach while you go, observability, chaos engineering)
- Microservices as an approach - especially in event-driven approach (Message Broakers, Queues, NoSql Stores)
- Business is the key, technology is just an enabler - embracing the MVP and time-to-market thinking is important
